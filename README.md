This is my submission for an interview with Suade.

The program provides a RESTful API for a database which contains information on some company inventories.

The user can get an XML file or a PDF if they have the report_id that they are looking for.

To use the program you would need to pip install PyGreSQL, flask, flask-restful and dicttoxml.

WARNING: There may be a problem if you have already installed pg as PyGreSQL may not work
